# Bayes' theorem

This is a theorem describing how the conditional probability of each set of possible causes for a given observed outcome can be computed from the knowledge of the probability of each cause and the conditional probability of the outcome of each cause. For example, if the risk of developing cancer is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately (by conditioning it on their age) than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification problems. They are based on Bayes' theorem with a strong "naive" independence assumption between the features. This means that, given a class label, the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature.
